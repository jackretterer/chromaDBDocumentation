LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible data framework for connecting custom data sources to large language models (LLMs). LlamaIndex essentially acts as the glue in the LLM stack. The library orchestrates your data ingestion, embedding models, LLMs, retrieval systems and evals so that you can focus on building applications quickly.

You can learn more about how LlamaIndex and Chroma work well together in the following links:
