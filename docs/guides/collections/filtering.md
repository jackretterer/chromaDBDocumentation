### Using Where filters

Chroma supports filtering queries by `metadata` and `document` contents. The `where` filter is used to filter by `metadata`, and the `where_document` filter is used to filter by `document` contents.

##### Filtering by metadata

In order to filter on metadata, you must supply a `where` filter dictionary to the query. The dictionary must have the following structure:

```python
{
    "metadata_field": {
        <Operator>: <Value>
    }
}
```

Filtering metadata supports the following operators:

- `$eq` - equal to (string, int, float)
- `$ne` - not equal to (string, int, float)
- `$gt` - greater than (int, float)
- `$gte` - greater than or equal to (int, float)
- `$lt` - less than (int, float)
- `$lte` - less than or equal to (int, float)

Using the $eq operator is equivalent to using the `where` filter.

```python
{
    "metadata_field": "search_string"
}

# is equivalent to

{
    "metadata_field": {
        "$eq": "search_string"
    }
}

```

:::note
Where filters only search embeddings where the key exists. If you search `collection.get(where={"version": {"$ne": 1}})`. Metadata that does not have the key `version` will not be returned.
:::

##### Filtering by document contents

In order to filter on document contents, you must supply a `where_document` filter dictionary to the query. We support two filtering keys: `$contains` and `$not_contains`. The dictionary must have the following structure:

```python
# Filtering for a search_string
{
    "$contains": "search_string"
}
```

```python
# Filtering for not contains
{
    "$not_contains": "search_string"
}
```

##### Using logical operators

You can also use the logical operators `$and` and `$or` to combine multiple filters.

An `$and` operator will return results that match all of the filters in the list.

```python
{
    "$and": [
        {
            "metadata_field": {
                <Operator>: <Value>
            }
        },
        {
            "metadata_field": {
                <Operator>: <Value>
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

An `$or` operator will return results that match any of the filters in the list.

```python
{
    "$or": [
        {
            "metadata_field": {
                <Operator>: <Value>
            }
        },
        {
            "metadata_field": {
                <Operator>: <Value>
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Using inclusion operators (`$in` and `$nin`)

The following inclusion operators are supported:

- `$in` - a value is in predefined list (string, int, float, bool)
- `$nin` - a value is not in predefined list (string, int, float, bool)

An `$in` operator will return results where the metadata attribute is part of a provided list:

```json
{
  "metadata_field": {
    "$in": ["value1", "value2", "value3"]
  }
}
```

An `$nin` operator will return results where the metadata attribute is not part of a provided list:

```json
{
  "metadata_field": {
    "$nin": ["value1", "value2", "value3"]
  }
}
```

:::note Practical examples
