## Running Chroma in client/server mode

<Tabs queryString groupId="lang" className="hideTabSwitcher">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

Chroma can also be configured to run in client/server mode. In this mode, the Chroma client connects to a Chroma server running in a separate process.

To start the Chroma server, run the following command:

```bash
chroma run --path /db_path
```

Then use the Chroma HTTP client to connect to the server:

```python
import chromadb
chroma_client = chromadb.HttpClient(host='localhost', port=8000)
```

That's it! Chroma's API will run in `client-server` mode with just this change. If you are interested in getting Chroma to production check out our [Production section](../production/index.md)

<!-- #### Run Chroma inside your application

To run the Chroma docker from inside your application code, create a docker-compose file or add to the existing one you have.

1. Download [`docker-compose.server.example.yml`](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/main/docker-compose.server.example.yml) file and [`config`](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/tree/main/config) folder along with both the files inside from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)
2. Rename `docker-compose.server.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`
3. Install docker on your local machine. [`Docker Engine`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [`Docker Desktop`](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/)
4. Install docker compose [`Docker Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Use following command to manage Dockerized Chroma:
- __Command to Start Chroma__: `docker-compose up -d`
- __Command to Stop Chroma__: `docker-compose down`
- __Command to Stop Chroma and delete volumes__
This is distructive command. With this command volumes created earlier will be deleted along with data stored.: `docker-compose down -v` -->

#### Using the python http-only client

If you are running chroma in client-server mode, you may not need the full Chroma library. Instead, you can use the lightweight client-only library.
In this case, you can install the `chromadb-client` package. This package is a lightweight HTTP client for the server with a minimal dependency footprint.

```python
pip install chromadb-client
```

```python
import chromadb
# Example setup of the client to connect to your chroma server
client = chromadb.HttpClient(host='localhost', port=8000)
```

Note that the `chromadb-client` package is a subset of the full Chroma library and does not include all the dependencies. If you want to use the full Chroma library, you can install the `chromadb` package instead.
Most importantly, there is no default embedding function. If you add() documents without embeddings, you must have manually specified an embedding function and installed the dependencies for it.

To run Chroma in client server mode, first install the chroma library and CLI via pypi:

```bash
pip install chromadb
```

Then start the Chroma server:

```bash
chroma run --path /db_path
```

The JS client then talks to the chroma server backend.

```js
// CJS
const { ChromaClient } = require("chromadb");

// ESM
import { ChromaClient } from 'chromadb'

const client = new ChromaClient();
```

You can also run the Chroma server in a docker container, or deployed to a cloud provider. See the [deployment docs](./deployment.md) for more information.
