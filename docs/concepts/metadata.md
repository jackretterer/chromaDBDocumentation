Metadata in ChromaDB refers to descriptive or structural information associated with the stored embeddings. This can include labels, timestamps, categories, or any other data useful for filtering or categorizing search results. Metadata enriches the embeddings, allowing users to perform more complex queries that combine vector similarity with traditional database query capabilities, thereby offering a multidimensional approach to data retrieval.
