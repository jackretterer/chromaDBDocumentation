Collections in ChromaDB serve as containers for organizing and managing related sets of embeddings and metadata. Similar to tables in relational databases, collections provide a way to segment the database according to different data types or use cases, supporting separate indexing strategies and search parameters. This organization facilitates efficient data management and retrieval, allowing for tailored configurations that match the specific needs of each collection.
