title: "📏 Distance Functions"
---

Distance functions are mathematical formulas used by ChromaDB to quantify the similarity between two embeddings. The choice of distance function—squared L2, inner product, and consince similarity—can significantly impact the relevance of search results. Each function measures similarity in a different way, making the selection of an appropriate distance function a critical step in configuring ChromaDB for specific use cases.
