Vector search is the mechanism by which ChromaDB enables the retrieval of data based on the similarity of embeddings. Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact matches or keyword similarities, vector search compares the distance between embeddings in a high-dimensional space, facilitating the discovery of items that are "similar" in content or meaning, even if not exactly the same. This capability is crucial for applications requiring nuanced data retrieval, such as recommendation systems or content discovery platforms.
